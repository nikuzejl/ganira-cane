ðŸ“„ Paper 1: The Political Evolution of Burundi
Abstract
This paper examines the political history of Burundi from independence in 1962 to present day. It highlights key events, figures, and institutional changes that have shaped the country's governance and political culture.

1. Introduction
Burundi, a landlocked country in East Africa, has experienced decades of political turbulence. Understanding its political evolution is crucial to assessing its current governance and democratic prospects.

2. Historical Background
After gaining independence from Belgium in 1962, Burundi oscillated between monarchy, military dictatorships, and fragile civilian rule. Ethnic tensions between Hutu and Tutsi groups dominated political narratives and led to repeated cycles of violence.

3. Civil War and Peace Process
The civil war (1993â€“2005) was one of Burundiâ€™s darkest periods. The Arusha Peace Agreement in 2000 was a significant turning point. International actors played a vital role in the peace negotiations and transitional government.

4. Post-War Politics and Recent Developments
Post-2005, Burundi adopted a power-sharing constitution and held democratic elections. However, President Pierre Nkurunzizaâ€™s third-term bid in 2015 triggered another political crisis. Recent leadership changes signal attempts at stabilization.

5. Challenges and Prospects
Persistent challenges include political repression, lack of media freedom, and human rights violations. Nonetheless, new leadership has raised hopes for reform.

6. Conclusion
Burundi's political evolution reflects a complex interplay of ethnicity, leadership, and international mediation. Continued investment in democratic institutions is essential for lasting peace.
